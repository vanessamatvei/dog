        <p> Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve participants' physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. 
            In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner;

        <p class="Olympics"> Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as 
            the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.</p>
        <h2>The Olympic Games</h2>
        <p class="Olympics">The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), 
            Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.</p>
        <h4>Non physical Sports</h4>
        <p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news.</p>
